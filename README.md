# Blood Pressure Measurement device using spatial pulse wave velocity in Human Radial Artery of waist

## Problem Statement: Modeling Blood Pressure Measurement Device
The objective of this project is to design and create a 3D Blender model of a blood pressure measurement device that utilizes spatial pulse wave velocity (SPWV) in the human radial artery of the waist.

## Theory:
Blood pressure measurement using SPWV involves determining the speed at which the pulse wave travels along the arterial wall. This technique can provide insights into arterial stiffness and overall cardiovascular health.

1. **Spatial Pulse Wave Velocity (SPWV)**:
   - **Pulse Wave Propagation**: The pulse wave is generated by the heart's contraction and travels through the arteries. The velocity of this wave is influenced by the elasticity and stiffness of the arterial walls.
   - **Measurement**: By measuring the time it takes for the pulse wave to travel between two points along the artery, SPWV can be calculated. This is often done using sensors placed at known distances apart.

2. **Blood Pressure Measurement**:
   - **Systolic and Diastolic Pressure**: Blood pressure is typically represented by two values, systolic (maximum pressure during heartbeats) and diastolic (minimum pressure between heartbeats).
   - **Correlation with SPWV**: There is a correlation between blood pressure and arterial stiffness, hence SPWV can be used as an indirect measure of blood pressure.

## Design and Implementation:
The blood pressure measurement device is modeled in Blender using the following steps:

1. **Specification**: Define the requirements and specifications for the device including sensor type, placement, and device dimensions.

2. **Conceptual Design**: Create a conceptual design of the device, including the layout of sensors, processor, and display. Sketch initial ideas and finalize the design concept.

3. **3D Modeling**: Use Blender to create a detailed 3D model of the device. Include all components such as the casing, sensors, display, and any buttons or controls.

4. **Texturing and Materials**: Apply appropriate textures and materials to the 3D model to make it visually realistic. Ensure that the model accurately represents the physical properties of the materials used.

5. **Animation and Simulation**: Create animations to demonstrate how the device operates. This can include the placement on the waist, the detection of pulse waves, and the display of blood pressure readings.

6. **Rendering**: Render high-quality images and videos of the 3D model. Use these for presentations, documentation, and promotional materials.

## Results:
The results section includes the final 3D model, rendered images, and animations:
- **3D Model**: Provide screenshots and files of the Blender model showing different views and components.
- **Renderings**: Include rendered images of the device in use, highlighting the sensors and display.
- **Animations**: Provide video animations demonstrating the operation of the device.
